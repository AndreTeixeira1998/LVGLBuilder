# New Test Tool

[**For Test**]arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-mingw32-2014 **on window** https://github.com/mrQzs/CreateLvglLib/releases

## Export LVGL Code Build
- Need to select hierarchical export 
- The cc path of Makefile originally needed to be modified, but this time the path of armgcc was added to the environment variable

## Create LVGL LIB

- Select the output device and input device file of the corresponding platform

- lv_drv_conf.h should also enable the corresponding input device and output device

- Both lvgl and drive are the latest official v7 version

  This project modified the source code of lvgl to achieve some functions (such as tabwidth adjustment), so the official lvgl can be replaced by the lvgl of this project.

## LVGL Simulator

program: https://github.com/mrQzs/Lvgl_Simulator
* support msvc 32/64 and mingw 32/64
* Put the code file generated by lvglbuilder in the testcode folder
* Just load the source code and modify the resolution in the lvconf.h

# LVGLBuilder
 GUI Builder for littlevgl release 6.0+ written in C++ and using LVGL for preview of the created GUI and Qt for the higher-level user interface for drag and drop of widgets as well as editing of properties and styles. 

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CURTLab/LVGLBuilder/master/doc/preview.png)

### Prerequisites
* [Qt 5.11+](https://www.qt.io/) - The Qt framework
* C++11
* LVGL 6.1 (included in source since a few adaptions are applied)

Tested:
 * Windows 10 + MSVC 2019 + Qt 5.15.1
 * Windows 10 + MinGW 8.1 + Qt 5.15.2
 * Ubuntu 18.04.4 + Qt 5.14.2
 * Ubuntu 20.04 + Qt 5.12.8

### Build
Building with console:
* Move to the cloned LVGLBuild directory
* Run ```qmake LVGLBuilder.pro```
* For gcc (Mac/Linux): ```make```
* For mingw: ```mingw32-make```
* For windows: ```jom``` (make sure that jom.exe is in the environment path)

Building with QtCreator:
* Download Qt from https://www.qt.io/download-open-source
* Install Qt with QtCreator
* Open the LVGLBuilder.pro file with QtCreator
* Click build project
* There are no special requironments, therefor it should build with QtCreator out of the box. 

### Usage
 * Create a new project and select the screen resolution
 * Simply drag and drop widgets from the list into the canvas
 * Widgets can be moved with the arrow keys or by dragging
 * Lock widgets to prevent editing (Unlock via right click context menu)
 * Drop a widget into another widget to set the parent
 * Save and load a project as json file using the menu or tool buttons
 * Mark widgets within the property editor as accessable via the c header
 * Export the project as c code using the menu (File -> Export -> C Project ...)
